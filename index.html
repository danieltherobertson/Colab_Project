Welcome, my beautiful thoroughbreeds, to the epicentre of my campaign. Here is where the magic happens! Why should you vote for me I hear you bellow, well I will tell you. With me as your supreme overlord, I mean student president, I will ensure that three separate policies are fulfilled.</p>

<p>1) Friendship! Let's all come together to help Bournemouth become the centre of the University friend zone.</p>

<p>2) Love! Love is, indeed, everywhere. Let it out people! Share the love! We can do so much together if we all learn to love one another. I know I love you all. Some have even called me omnibenevolent. I'm not 100% on what that means, but I hear it's good.</p>

<p>3) Immigration. Get those silly foreigners out of our country! There's not enough space for us, so why share what we don't have, eh? Out with the old and in with the new, but in this case, out with everyone that isn't British and in with pancakes! I'm bloody starving.</p>

<p>I will give you anything that your heart so desire. You want a premium leatherback Oxford Dictionary? You’ve got it. You want caviar with your lunch? Done. So make sure you vote for me Alexander Robert Samson Ellesbury in the up and coming election, and see your dream of a better university fulfilled.</p> 

<p>And if that is not enough to sway you into voting for me, which is bizarre because that is some great writing, then come and have a look around my incredible website, which I coded all by myself (I know I’m bloody talented) and see even more reasons to why you should vote for me Alexander Robert Samson Ellesbury.</p>
