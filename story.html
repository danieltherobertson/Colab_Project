<p>This bloody handsome devil is me. Alexander Robert Samson Ellesbury. A name so nice I'll say it twice. Alexander Robert Samson Ellesbury. I'm a 20-something year old politics student born and bred in Bournemouth. That's right people, I'm a British pureblood! My pastimes include polo, line dancing and leading our University's debating society into verbal warfare. I'm also quite the aquatic connoisseur - I have over 3 badges in the backstroke! I occasionally like to put my feet up with a glass of chardonnay and a good movie; my personal favourites include Gone With the Wind, Schindler's List and last but by absolutely no means least, The Postman Pat movie. Masterpiece.</p><p>My hero is the great man that is Boris Johnson - ah Boris Johnson how i’d love to brush his hair and have him call me his little puppy. Boris Johnson (or the great BJ as his friends call him) taught me how to be a man, everything I know about manhood and manliness I learned from the great BJ. And because of this I have dedicated my life to becoming what the great BJ ultimately wants to be which is the prime minster/ supreme overlord which is why I am doing politics here at this “great” university. Although originally I was going go to Oxford University, however a private call from the head of politics at Bournemouth University swayed me to reject that crappy university and come here to “sunny” Bournemouth.</p>

                	<img src="img/g_bio_pic.jpg" id="g_bio"><p>Ah, Geoffrey. What can I say about my loyal right-hand man that isn't already stated by his steely, silent demeanour? He is my rock, the glue that holds my campaign together, and my bestest buddy. Having said that, as he's never said a word to me I'm not even sure if he knows where he is half the time. Bollocks to it, I love the little bastard.</p>
<p>I would tell you about his hobbies, his age and whatnot, but seriously, the man never gives an inch. Not a bloody word. I sometimes wonder if he's smuggling terrorists into the country in his ever-closed mouth, but I guess some things are best left to the imagination. He'd never betray like that or contradict me which is why he will be my hand of the president. I’m not going to make the same mistake as that little shit out of Game of Thrones, Joffrey. I mean if he didn’t have that old git telling him what to do, he could have done whatever he wanted, so having Geoffrey as my hand will mean I can do anything that I so desire. Anyway a vote for me is also a vote for Geoffrey, but don’t let that put you off.</p>
